# Valley of the Scarabs 🐞
### CS50x 2026 - Problem Set 0: Scratch

**Valley of the Scarabs** is an interactive game inspired by Ancient Egypt, built entirely in Scratch as my first assignment for CS50x.

## 🎮 Project Description
You play as an archaeologist exploring the Valley of the Kings. Your goal is to catch the falling **Golden Scarabs** to gain "Ancient Power". But be careful! If you miss them and they hit the ground, you lose power.

## ✨ Key Features
This project meets all CS50 requirements:
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Uses a custom block `Respawn Scarab` with an input parameter to randomize the falling speed of each beetle.
- **Score System:** Tracks progress using the `Ancient Power` variable.
- **Interactive Controls:** Smooth movement using Left/Right arrow keys.
- **Multiple Sprites:** Includes an Explorer, a Beetle, and background ambience.
- **Loops & Conditionals:** Uses complex logic to handle spawning, catching, and missing the targets.
